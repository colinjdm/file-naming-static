# file-naming-utility

This utility is intended to allow easier and quicker file naming while filing documents for the public record.  Enter the pertinent information, and the filename is concatenanted and can be copied with one-click, ready to be pasted into Word, Adobe, etc.

This is a pared-down version of my CS50 Final Project, stripped of it's Python and SQL attributes.
